2. home-loans.html: changing for 'Deposit' field from radio button to dropdown (desktop, mobile, mobile refinement popup)
3. homeloan-controller-2.0.js (new)
4. interestRateManager-homeloan-2.0.js (new) - angular notifier added based on the latest interestRateManager.js provided from ING (Laura)
5. repayment information popup style issue - blue mobile modal dialog missing height: 100% (not sure what happened but this is not visible on production either)
