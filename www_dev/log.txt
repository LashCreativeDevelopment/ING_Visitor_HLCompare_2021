 */



Questions:
---------
- Showing <10%, 10%-20%, 20%-30% ... in the deposit dropdown, is this ok? 
- Default Deposit? (used to be >20%) => TBC
- Can we get sample json (currenteffective response)?



Update log:
----------
1. homeloan-style.min.css: zindex of popover to 1051 from 8 as the popover in the mobile tooltip, while the refinement popup is opened, goes behind
2. home-loans.html: changing deposit radio button to dropdown (desktop, mobile, mobile refinement popup)
3. homeloan-controller-2.0.js (new)
4. interestRateManager-homeloan-2.0.js (new) - angular notifier added based on the latest interestRateManager.js provided from ING (Laura)
