 */



Notes:
-----
- removed the 'Important: Interest Only repayments are not currently available on any of our Owner Occupied fixed rate loans.' on FRL with OO & IO combination.



Questions:
---------
- Showing <10%, 10%-20%, 20%-30% ... in the deposit dropdown, is this ok?
- Default Deposit? (used to be >20%)
- What are the 'All borrowings' deposit criteria for?
- Asssumption made to Comparison rate code to have either 'CP_' or 'COMP_' prefix to the rate code
- FRL did not show any rates for OO with IO - the excel sheet now have rates for OO with IO combination
- Can we get sample json (currenteffective response)?
